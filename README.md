### Features
* Bunnyhop
* Chams
* Glow
* No flash

* Skin Changer - Press `F1` and wait 1 second until the skin shows (this is a hack to get the skin changer to work I am looking for a better solution if you know it, let me know)
* Triggerbot

### Build
1. `npm i`
2. `npm start` - make sure csgo is running before you do this

If you get banned for using this cheat it is not my fault, this project is to display how you'd create a cheat in electron, I have very little game hacking knowledge, I just like playing around.
